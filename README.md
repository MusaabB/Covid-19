In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, I embarked on a project to analyze and visualize the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases across U.S. counties. Utilizing ArcGIS Pro, I aimed to create a detailed and dynamic map that would not only track the progression of the virus but also highlight key trends and emerging hotspots. This project was driven by the need to provide actionable insights and a visual representation of the pandemic's impact, which could inform public health strategies and responses.
